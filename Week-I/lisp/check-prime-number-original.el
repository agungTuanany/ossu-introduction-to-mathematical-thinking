;;;; Commentary:

;;;; Code:
;; Question:
;; How would you show that not every number of the form (N = (p1 路 p2 路 p3 路 ... 路 pn) + 1)
;; is prime, where (p1, p2, p3, ..., pn) is the list of all prime numbers?
;;
;; Process:
;; 1. prime-p function:
;; - correctly checks for prime numbers by iterating up to the square root of 'n'
;; 2. generate-prime function:
;; - generates a list of the first 'count' prime numbers
;; 3. product-of-list function:
;; - calculates the product of a list of numbers
;; 4. calculate-n function:
;; - computes the product of the first 'n' primes and adds 1.
;;
;; Expected output:
;; The output should demonstrate the correct calculation where:
;; (2 . 3 . 5 .7 . 11 = 2310) and adding 1 gives 2311

;; Function to calculate the product of a list of numbers
(defun product-of-list (numbers)
  "Calculate the product of a list of NUMBERS."

;; Function to calculate N
(defun calculate-n (n)
  "Calculate N = (p1 * p2 * ... * pn) + 1 for the first N prime numbers."
  (interactive)

;; Example usage
;; Calculate for the first 5 primes
(calculate-n 5)
